### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike, a programmer and computational scientist.

Professionally I mainly write molecular simulation codes, however, I've been programming in one way or another since I was a child.

Computers and programming are my hobbies, so I've played around with a few different things in my free time.

Lately I am exploring and enjoying some full stack development using React and Spring. Some of the things I put together are on this GitHub.

All of them are just working MVPs to show certain functionality. They're neither supposed to be optimised nor completely cleaned up.

The Spring backend in the example repositories is hosted on render, with the corresponding frontend on GitHub pages.

Some stuff I play around with (Tech Stack):
